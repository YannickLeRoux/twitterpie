## Twitterpie

# Web App made with Flask, Tweepy and Chart.js

This actually my first web app, so the code is going to get better with time
(hopefully!)


I used the file `'twitter_parser/blacklist.txt'` to remove from results the words that would be
meaningless, like "they" "but" "although" etc, so feel free to add some more, or words from other languages too.
